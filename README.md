Parametric least-square fitting.

Created on January 2018

I provide my code here if you need it, however I am not an expert in Python. Be aware that you might find better fitting libraries on GitHub!!! You can send your questions or your comments on https://groups.google.com/d/forum/lsfit

### LSfit
Fitting method using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

### newton
Newton's algorithm, to find the solution of f(X)=0

### Usual_functions
Some functions you may need for fitting, such as Gaussian and Moffat (both in 1D and 2D)

### Test_***
Test files. Feel free to use them to handle LSfit
